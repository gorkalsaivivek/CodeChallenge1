Key Counts
Write a function that sums up keys in a text file. The file contains data in
the format of
"key,count" where key is a string and count is an integer. Each line will
only contain one key-count pair. The output should contain each key
occurring in the file along with the sum of the count for all occurrences of
a given key.
For Example:
John,2
Jane,3
John,4
Jane,5
Would result in the output: "The total for John is 6. The total for Jane is
8."
